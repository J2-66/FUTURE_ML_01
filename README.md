# FUTURE_ML_01
I build a predictive analytics dashboard that helps retail businesses forecast their future sales. I work with historical transaction data, apply machine learning models to predict upcoming trends, and present insights with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# 📊 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard
# 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered sales forecasting dashboard to help retail businesses predict future sales trends and make data-driven decisions.
Using machine learning models like Prophet, ARIMA, and XGBoost, the system provides accurate demand forecasts, and the results can be visualized in Power BI or Python-based charts.

# ✨ Features

📈 Time-series forecasting using Prophet, ARIMA, and XGBoost

🧹 Data preprocessing and feature engineering

📊 Interactive dashboard for visualizing sales trends and predictions

📂 Modular Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation

🔮 Supports multi-period forecasting for better decision-making

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI (for visualization, optional)
